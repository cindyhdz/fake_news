# fake_news

## Overview
Group 3 selected “fake news” for the final project. The intent of the analysis is to identify fake news articles based on the title, author, and text within the article. The dataset categorizes each article with a 0 or 1 — the 0 is indicative of a reliable source (therefore not fake news) and a 1 is indicative of fake news!  
Long short-term memory (LSTM) was utilized to conduct this analysis. 

## Fake News—why?
Due to the inclement political climate, identifying reputable sources for news information has become a necessity to make responsible choices at the polls. Additionally, we as a group believe that it's only ethical to supply citizens with accurate and truthful information in order to make decisions based on facts.

## Data Source
fake_news dataset was found on Kaggle as part of a large community that has implemented big machine learning models and deep learning under this dataset.
